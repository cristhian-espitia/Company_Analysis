The company The Best Company, dedicated to producing automobile spare parts, knows that the low productivity of its collaborators is largely due to absenteeism during working hours. To carry out an analysis of this and verify it, you require the support of the Analytical Consultant (you), in order to establish the main behavior patterns of the collaborators, regarding their position and work areas, the hours contracted and absenteeism or disabilities they may have.
